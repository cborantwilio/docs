# Rules of Development

My personal notes from mentorship meetings

## Absolute Rules of Development

1. If you didn't test it, it doesn't work
1. If you didn't set scale design limits, everyone assumes it is infinite scale
1. If you didn't set performance boundaries, everyone assumes it is sub-ms real time
1. If you think you need a transactional datastore, you are probably wrong
1. Customer trust is a precious thing. Guard it
1. Development is a partnership not a dictatorship - work as a team and not not allow domineering individuals to push the team around
1. Make sure you monitor from a customer's perspective - you do not want them finding problems before you do
1. Software is cheap to build and expensive to maintain. Spend more effort lowering the cost of maintinance by creating a budget for it off the top
1. Dates are imagined by someone who doesn't build software. Treat dates as business desirability targets - no one will remember next year that you were a few weeks late. No one will forget if your software is buggy or causes huge outages
1. The next shiny new feature will never match the years of value the product has already built. Customers pay for what we have already delivered. We need to ensure they get what they pay for and not over focus on potential of future gains 
1. Quality is never the leg of the stool to cut in a mature product. Scope and Dates are the things that need to move
1. Successful products have a vNext that is well understood and a vCurrent that we can prove is on the path to vNext
