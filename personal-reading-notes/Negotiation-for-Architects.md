# Negotiation for Architects

Notes from my Architecture Book Club's reading (summer 2020) of Chris Voss’s [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-audiobook/dp/B01COR1GM2/ref=sr_1_1?tag=storyshots0d-20&crid=3E11GOEMBO55O&dchild=1&keywords=never+split+the+difference+audiobook&qid=1600265115&sprefix=bestselling%2caps%2c245&sr=8-1) which attempts to contextualize lessons learned by Voss in his years as an FBI hostage negotiator, and setting them into a business context. 

Many times we hear our tech leads and managers frustrated by not being able to accomplish some of their goals, and negotiation prowess is a key skill that could prove helpful. For this reason I thought it might be useful to share some of the insights the CREx Architect team have gleaned from the book, in a condensed form that might be used more as a cheat sheet. To get the deeper understanding of ‘why’ recommendations are made, please go and read the book. It is a fun light read and worth your time. 

## Fundamental Assumptions

* Almost any human interaction can be a form of negotiation
* Problem solving in a group setting is a common place where negotiation can be helpful
* The goal of the negotiation is not meeting in the middle, it is about parties agreeing on the right thing to do
* Negotiation is a key influencing skill that Architects should work on
* Architects should be negotiating with lots of stakeholders - product managers, scrum teams, other architects and engineering managers all the time 
* Negotiation is **not** about the logical, it is about the emotional - cognitive biases and emotions always do come into play — which is why tech leads and architects commonly find it frustrating

## The Process

### Gather Information

The you are operating at a disadvantage if you have less information that the others you are talking to. Focus first on gathering as much information as you can in order to build the most accurate mental model you can of the other person’s world. Start by establishing yourself as someone that is listening to their concerns. Build trust slowly by making sure they are being heard - the safety it creates will help open them up to partnering. This is accomplished via:

* **Active Listening** - listen and ask clarifying questions that are open ended - you want them to talk not just answer pointed questions tersely
* **Mirroring** - rephrase the last thing they said but turning it into a question - like an invitation to continue or say more
* **Politeness** - Use phases like “I am sorry but...” to establish rapport
* **Silence** - by inserting long pauses and silence it encourages the other person to fill the dead air because they feel that there is an expectation that they should continue
* **Repetition** - do not be afraid to repeat, you are trying to mine information
* **Voice Control** - tone and emotion matter. If your tone and body language do not match your words, you defeat the purpose. Think consciously about what tone and speed you use and which non verbal queues you are sending out
    * Use a positive or fun tone and voice by default - try to be relaxed most of the time so that you establish a comfortable and open baseline - it makes the shifts have more impact and meaning
    * When you want to focus on trust and authority building, slow your tempo and use a calm voice - be soothing like a late night DJ might
    * Be very careful but when you need to push back and you must punctuate the message, be direct and assertive. You should not remain in this voice for long but it is useful for letting the other party know that you are treading in very serious grounds where you do not wish to remain long. Get back to the default voice quickly

### Demonstrate Understanding

Once you feel like you have gathered sufficient information to form a clear picture of what the other party’s world looks like, start demonstrating to them that you have reached understanding. The goal here is to build trust by proving to the other party that you have been listening and internalizing their point of view, and that they can trust that you will be fair. We achieve this by using skills like:

* **Labeling** - be sure to label emotions - say “It seems like you are unhappy with ...” or “It sounds like you are focused on ...” in order to shine the spotlight on the emotions. 
    * By labeling negative emotions and hitting the target, we can diffuse them. 
    * Labeling positive emotions can reinforce them. 
    * It helps the other party to de-escalate when they know their feelings are recognized
* **Get to “No” Early to Create Safety** - Getting someone to say yes can be Counterfeit - they may say yes just to get you to go away, but then have no intention of following through. We want commitment, no appeasement. “No” on the other hand is a powerful word that makes the other party feel like they are in control of defining boundaries. If we design our questions to get a boundary on the table early and make it safe for the other person to disagree, then it opens them up to exploring those boundaries and maybe even changing them. Getting them to a place where they are safe to say ‘No’ early means that we start exploring those boundaries in a productive way earlier
* **Get to “That’s Right”** - Our overall goal in oder to show the other person we have understood them is to work our way to statements-phrased-as-questions that provokes some variations of “That’s right” as the response - when we get there the other party feels well understood and is ready to actually start problem solving with you

### Paint Your Picture

Now that you have setup a safe environment and have demonstrated that you understand the other party’s position, you will want to start to get them to realign their thinking to your point of view. The goal here is to leverage the shared connection you have established and be asking them to solve your problem for you. You aren’t convincing them of anything, you are asking them to work on the problem with you and help you solve it. Some of the tools for doing this include:

* **Ask Their Help** - resist the urge to make a proposal. Try to spend time framing your point of view by asking questions and making invitations for the other party to help you solve the problem - let them make some early proposals on how to solve the problem without actually establishing too much about the solution - focus on helping them to understand YOUR view of the problem
* **Resist First Offer** - no matter what the opening offer is, hold off and refocus the conversation on the problems you need them to help solve. Do not get into the details of why their solution won’t work, just repeat your ground level questions about a solution 
* **Anchoring** - early on (but after the other party has started making proposals) establish something at an extreme beyond what you would accept. This reorients that other party’s sense of where a reasonable solution can be reached and acts as a ‘setpoint’ for a solution. Highlight to the other party the things that you have to lose if you can’t reach a solution
* **Empathy** - stay attuned to the other party’s fears and uncertainties. Tap into their loss aversion fears by making clear offers that while outside their range of desires, is still better than reaching no solution
* **Fairness** - the other party should always feel like you are treating them fairly. If there is even a whiff that they might feel you are being unfair stop right there. Apologize and cite your explicit desire to be fair. But being fair does not mean being a push over. It means being fair to both points of view

### Problem Solving

Once you have painted the picture of your reality for the other party, start working in the spirit of problem solving. Focus on creating a relationship where you are open to proposals and are listening to them, but put them in a position where they are negotiating against themselves until you feel you have reached a solution that you feel is optimal. In the end you will be accepting the proposal that they built themselves.

* **Servant Control** - like servant leadership, by establishing an aspect of you asking the other party how they want to do things gives them a sense of control in the situation that keeps opening them up to work more closely together. This in turn puts you in a position to influence through shared purpose. Common sample questions can include:
    * What about this is important to you?
    * How can I help make this better for us?
    * How would you like me to proceed?
    * How can we solve this problem?
    * What are we trying to accomplish here?
    * How can I do that?
* **Choices** - when you do counter propose things, by using ranges of possible answers you can be more cooperative even when you are pushing towards a particular goal. Back your points up with evidence of course, but be open to discussions anywhere in the ranges - this both limits the discussion to the areas you want to range in, and prevents the other party from becoming too defensive because you are demonstrating your openness to different solutions
* **Absurdly Specific** - instead of using rough round values which everyone can agree are made up estimates, instead use oddly specific numbers when proposing values. These specificity makes the other party believe that your values are well thought out and set at a level for a particular reason and causes them to take them more seriously than round numbers 
* **Pivot** - if you find yourselves stuck and unable to agree, pivot to discussing some other point in the solution space. Don’t let yourselves get hung up on the hardest problems when you can build a vault full of common ground first. This forms a basis of agreement that makes it easier to tackle the hard subjects later
* **Concessions** - think of concessions that you can easily make that do not impact your most important objectives. By making using these concessions and treating them as important parts of the negotiation. These may seem inconsequential to you, but it continues to build common ground with the other party and the good will sets up positive feelings about the interaction

## Execution Tips

Some things to keep in mind while you are dealing with others:

* **Body Language Speaks Louder than Words** - the [Mehrabian Rule](https://www.rightattitudes.com/2008/10/04/7-38-55-rule-personal-communication/) says that 7% of a message is word choice, 38% is tone of voice; but the other 55% is body language. That means that tone and body language — how you say something is 10x more impactful than what you actually say. If you do not align your words with your tone and language, you will be perceived to be dishonest which will defeat any attempt to build a relationship for a successful solution
* **Rule of 3 Agreements** - to know if an agreement is genuine, if the same person agrees to the same thing said different ways 3 times in the same conversation, then they very likely are in genuine agreement. Use labeling and summarization to revisit agreements periodically in the conversation, and use calibrated confirmation questions late in the conversation to test to ensure you have true shared purpose.
* **Fewer Words** - studies show that people being less than forthcoming tend to dance and use more words. You are received to be more honest when you say fewer words and this leads to better relationship building
* **First Person Pronouns** -  by using personal names you can deescalate confrontations and remind the other party that you are both people and brings attention back to the human part of the problem solving 
* **Name Fatigue** - using a personal name is better than impersonal pronouns but be aware that people can get tired of hearing their own name so mix in use of other names — especially your own 
* **Master Your Emotions** - be self critical and realize what things are triggering your emotions. Take conscious steps - take a break, change the topic, pivot to another negotiating point. De-escalate yourself and do not make offers or rejections while your feelings are in high gear
* **Take Your Time** - ignore time pressures and the natural urge to rush to a solution. Use time as a tool that is on your side - the other party likely feels the time pressure too so let their time pressure exert its influence on them and not on you

## Conclusion

While the book is written specifically about adversarial negotiations, the same principles apply well to simply collaborative problem solving. Remember the the purpose in Architects applying these techniques is not to ‘win’ at making their point of view prevalent, but to help resolve disagreements around prioritization and methods for making our customers more successful. 

## Appendix

### Ackerman Model

One proven method of negotiating to maximize returns in the [Ackerman Model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/05/08/it-pays-to-master-this-one-negotiation-tactic/?sh=228a94cf6eaa) 

* understand your target - what range are you willing to settle for
* set your first offer at 65% of that target to establish an anchor
* figure out 3 intermediate offers that get you to your target (ie 85%, 95%, 100%)
* Use empathy while negotiating, but use different ways of saying no to keep negotiations open. Look to make the other side make counter offers. Take time and carefully consider each counter offer in silence before thinking about raising your offer in succession to your target offer
* Calculate the final target you are willing to pay using precise (and arbitrary) numbers rather than round ones
* Throw in something of little value that the other party doesn’t value as part of your final offer - it make the other party believe that you have given up everything you reasonably can and are trying to find some way to provide more value to them in the deal
