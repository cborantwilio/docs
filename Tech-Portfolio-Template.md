# <Template> Technical Portfolio 

See [Building an Architectural Portfolio] for more information

## Portfolio Context

> In this section of the document you want to outline the contexts of ownership that explains what this team’s charter of responsibility is. List the high level responsibilities, modules and services that the team owns and what themes bind them together to give the reader an overview of what specifically they are responsible for. 

## Technology Vision

> Lay out a 1-2 year time horizon of things the team wants to accomplish in each area of responsibility - the themes that you think that the team should be investing in, including major changes. This isn’t the place to list individual tickets, this is painting a less specific picture of where you think the team should go with the things that they own

## Toil Assessment

> Talk about where you feel the team is in terms of cost of ‘run-the-business’ — how much of the team’s efforts go to keeping the machine working as opposed to building new things. Remember to be a little self critical but realistic.

## Tech Enablement Report

> Include a link to the work items report for your team’s logged tech enablement.  

## Portfolio Backlog

> Replace table with your proposed projects
