# SDLC for Performance & Scale

We have spent years building a reputation of helping customers build high performance and high scale applications. More than any nifty new feature we might build, this is why customers choose us. To ensure that we can maintain that promise, we have teams of experts and tools to help ensure that when we build new things, they can meet those customer expectations. This document seeks to help guide an engineering team on how to engage with our experts and our tools in order to ensure that the next feature or service that the team builds meets or exceeds the standards that customers have come to expect.

### SaaS SDLC Flow

If we take a typical SaaS-style SDLC flow, there are touch points for Performance & Scale in just about every phase of the lifecycle for Commerce Cloud. Our resources can help your team be successful in each phase. 

### Phase: Plan 

During the planning phase teams should be generating Non-Functional Requirements - the unspoken requirements that drive the design. Getting these fleshed out early help the team understand what success really looks like, and helps them to compare alternatives in a quantitative way.



### Phase: Design

During this phase teams should be comparing the possibilities and doing spikes and paper prototype testing of their assumptions as they document and vet their designs. 



### Phase: Code & Build 

During this phase the team is iteratively building their software and creating basic testing materials to help ensure they will perform to specification. 



### Phase: Test

During this phase teams need to understand if their components meet the NFRs defined and understand both the breaking points and the scale of their components in isolation.



### Phase: Release & Deploy

Before releasing into production, we need to gain confidence that the whole system, not just the component we recently created continue to function performantly at scale without impacting the rest of the system.



### Phase: Operate & Monitor

Once your software is deployed to production, the job is just begun - we must watch and learn to operate and to scale the system under load. We need to analyze the real world usage and feed that back into our NFRs, design process, and proposed projects.
