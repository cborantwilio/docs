# Creating Technical Alignment

When taking on any large project it is easy to become anxious about a great many things that raise doubts in ones mind about the likelihood of success.  This is often referenced as FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).  Generally FUD is healthy in that it forces us to re-examine our assumptions but FUD can also lead engineering teams to stall in making progress.  In sufficiently large organizations FUD can also lead to endless debate and in the worst case destructive behaviors where two opposing points of view attempt to undermine each other.  

This document attempts to provide a flexible construct for working through the doubts in a transparent and open way.  It focuses on acknowledgment of different points of view and facilitating a discussion around checkpoints to help prove or disprove concerns.

This method can be used when rolling out some of our more ambitious projects when mis-alignment begins to happen between different teams within our organization.



# Large Change Working Group Template

This document is written to expose risks and help us all get on the same page about how to evaluate and prioritize mitigation of these risks. It is expected that all systems have weaknesses and risks - it should be contributed to and consumed in the spirit of transparentness and should not convey undue concern.  This is helpful when launching a new service or attempting to institute any large change each of which will have a list of concerns.

### Review Team

*Below are examples of stakeholders.  Stakeholders should be broad and include individuals that will be directly impacted now or in the future by the decision.  It is expected that not all of these individuals are bought in to the Large Change - the goal here is to ensure that these voices are heard and concerns documented.*

|Product Engineering	|	|
|---	|---	|
|Infrastructure Engineering	|	|
|Site Reliability Engineering	|	|
|Support	|	|
|Quality	|	|
|Architecture	|	|

### Top Concerns

*The goal here is to track the TOP concerns of the group.  The group may maintain a longer list but the goal here is to track the 10-15 concerns.  The priority of a concern is weighted based on the potential impact and the likelihood of it being seen.  Below are real examples from an initial launch of the Commerce Cloud Java Web Adaptor which was built as the edge for all traffic and deployed before a peak holiday season for the first time.*

|Priority	|What concerns us?	|What is the effect a customer will see?	|How likely is it to be a problem?	|

### Immediate Mitigation Plans

*Some changes require immediate change in direction based on learnings.  The goal here is to quickly ensure that when an issue arises that requires such attention there is an assigned owner and believable incremental next step that can move the needle forward.*

### Major issues (Sev1s) over the last few months

*Every large project should have some metric to determine if it remains on the right path.  For Services this can be the count of Sev1â€™s.  For large/broad standards this might be tracked via NPS scores or the largest/most frequently called out gaps.*
