# Responsibility Oriented Teams

Today as the Chatbot team were giving their presentation in the Architecture Summit and I started hearing the questions being asked, one question made me draw a sharp breath. 


> **Should every service have a devops and an inf team?**


I held that breath waiting for the answer, and my stomach churned and I sighed audibly when the Chatbot leader agreed that it might be an idea **worth exploring**. A classic anti-pattern that is a well known trap. General Ackbar wouldn't have fallen for it...

### **Zinda! His face black, his eyes red!**

For me this Architecture Summit was an eye opener. This was gathering of the thought leaders in the company and it was obvious that a large group **do not** truly grok Service Ownership or how to staff teams to be successful in a **DevOps Culture**. That led me to start reflecting on the behavior of our Commerce Cloud teams. Several times over the past few months I've felt worried when I hear our team discuss the 'hybrid transition'. The managers are focusing their efforts on making QA engineers learn coding as their primary, and improving unit test coverage as their secondary. 

### **Shaka. When the walls fell...** 

I thought about our service ownership — or lack there of in most teams currently. How hard it has been for the dev managers to understand why and how to do **monitoring** of the live production and why no one is really digging in and embracing it. I thought about the lack of **negotiation** with the POs — in both directions. I thought about the lack of ownership over **technical debt management**, and **technical portfolio management**. I thought about the **mirco-fracturing** teams so we can work on more in **parallel** - and **lack of collaboration** (beyond a couple of people on a particular feature)... they are teams of indviduals who report to the same manager in many cases, and not what I think of as a true agile **team**.

### **The river Termac. In Winter.**

So a thought has occurred to me: Are the teams struggling because we aren't staffing them appropriately for the culture we want to build? I built my first Hybrid Engineering Team in 2008, and always focused on that style team ever since — I used **Full Responsibility Teams**. In that model, teams only succeed or fail together.

### **Sokath! His eyes uncovered!**

I also reflected on the staffing decisions we made to help those teams — to fill skill based roles within the team — we looked for different individuals who could play the role of SME roles across the teams for differing purposes. **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master** and **Team Tech Lead** played vital roles, but just as important were  the **Quality Maven** and **DevOps Lead**. The emphasis was on enabling the whole team to participate, but for the SME to help educate and audit what was happening in their areas of particular expertise.

### **Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra**

Something that has troubled me since joining is the distance between the engineers responsible for Infrastructure & Operations, and those responsible for Product Engineering. In a public cloud environment, that **division feels quite artificial**. Paul's teams and Sergei's team seem indistinguishable in charter. As a discipline, Public Cloud Infrastructure Engineering looks more like product software development than classic data center infrastructure operations does. The line is blurry at best. 

### **Temba, his arms wide**

In order to enable our teams to be successful, they need to truly own their work, but to do so, we need to think more broadly about the composition of teams post the coming reorg. We need to seed the teams with the **right skills**, and we need to help them understand that Hybrid Teams do not mean 'everyone becomes a developer' — it means '**everyone puts the team first**'. It means we need to reinforce the roles and double down on making sure that the engineers filling those roles feel both empowered and respected - and that they feel responsible for their area of expertise.

### **The beast at Tanagra**

To really understand DevOps culture, we also need to seed each scrum team with a DevOps Lead who has an Inf/Ops background. It isn't sufficient to 'work well' with the current teams — the Ops mindset needs to be **embedded** in the team just the same way that Quality Mavens are. This will not be easy, but we should engage the CC Inf Leadership team and try to figure out how we might be able to better build our teams for success. Right now we are forcing developers to learn cloud infrastructure and monitoring on their own, without experience to help them. We need to set them up for success — and the best way to do that is to enlist folks with that experience and mindset, mix them into the teams to help empower the teams to understand the viewpoint from within.

We also have to revisit how we measure our teams. Teams get very good at what you measure. We need to have our **metrics match our message**. We need to track only those things that actually matter to our outcomes and we need to **inspect what we expect**. We have to have not just metrics but the next level of detail being consistently inspected to ensure we aren't just dealing with garbage-in-garbage-out metrics - we need to ensure that we have a process for review and adjustment on the qualitative aspects too. We should also have these metrics standardized across teams.
